- expired cookies mess things up, unauthorized gives 500
- loading animation after login/register other stuff - not important
- moving tasks up and down
- marking tasks for review/done
- assigning members to tasks
- ~~move columns~~ if i want to move a column i need to change swap positions of 2 columns and that sucks, OR i could create a new api route to swap columns but this sounds bad

- project repoort: tasks finished within some period, assigned, busy members, timeline
